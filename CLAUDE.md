# HubSpot token model

The codebase uses TWO separate HubSpot private app tokens:

- **`HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`** — read-only token for production CRM. Used by Slices 2–11 for deal search, project import, deal context refresh. NEVER used for writes.
- **`HUBSPOT_WRITE_ACCESS_TOKEN`** — write-enabled token, added in Slice 12 only. Used exclusively by the Mark-Accepted writeback flow. Read paths must NOT use this token.

This separation is intentional: it makes accidental writes during development structurally impossible, not just unlikely.
